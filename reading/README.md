# Grafa Reading Lists

We believe strongly in the power of a good book. With that in mind, here are some suggested reading lists. We have attempted to organise items into lists that might appeal to folks in particular roles, however please don't consider these groupings mutually exclusive by any means.

## For everyone

- The Startup Playbook
- The Lean Startup

## For developers

- Clean Code
- The Pragmatic Programmer
- Domain-driven Design
- Refactoring
- Lean Software Development
