## Methodologies

### The Twelve-Factor App

At Grafa we build our applications with operations and maintainability in mind. In the modern era, software is commonly delivered as a service: called web apps, or software-as-a-service. The **twelve-factor app** is a methodology for building software-as-a-service apps that:

- Use declarative formats for setup automation, to minimize time and cost for new developers joining the project;
- Have a clean contract with the underlying operating system, offering maximum portability between execution environments;
- Are suitable for deployment on modern cloud platforms, obviating the need for servers and systems administration;
- Minimize divergence between development and production, enabling continuous deployment for maximum agility;
- And can scale up without significant changes to tooling, architecture, or development practices.

We require all our developers to study and understand the documentation available at [The Twelve-Factor App][a1] site.
